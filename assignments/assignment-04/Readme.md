# Assignment 04: Implementing Multi-Provider LLM Integration Using aisuite

**Objective:**

This assignment focuses on simplifying the integration of multiple large language model (LLM) providers using the aisuite library. You will gain hands-on experience in utilizing a single unified approach for accessing different LLMs, reducing the complexity of individual configurations.

**Task:**  
Explore and implement a working example of the aisuite library with any two LLM providers of your choice (e.g., Gemini and Groq). Demonstrate how the same code structure can be reused for multiple LLMs simply by changing the provider:model string. 

**Guidelines:**
- Implement your solution in a , ensuring clear explanations and code snippets throughout.
- Refer to the aisuite documentation for assistance: https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite
- If you encounter any implementation or execution errors, provide a detailed explanation of the error, you can refer to the official documentation.
