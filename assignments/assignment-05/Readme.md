# Assignment 05: Exploring Gemini 2.0 Video and Audio Analysis

**Objective:**

This assignment focuses on implementing Gemini 2.0 using its new SDK to showcase its ability to analyze both video and audio inputs. You will record a personal introduction video, provide it to the LLM, and test its understanding and analysis of both video and audio components.

**Task:**

- Record a personal introduction video that includes your voice.
- Implement a working example using the Gemini 2.0 SDK to:
  1.  Upload the recorded video to Gemini 2.0.
  2.  Analyze both the visual and audio components of the video.
  3.  Interact with the LLM by asking it questions based on the video content.
- Test and confirm Gemini 2.0's capability to analyze both video and audio seamlessly without requiring separate audio input files.

**Guidelines:**

- Implement your solution in a well-documented Google Colab notebook. Include clear explanations, code snippets, and the steps you followed.
- Refer to the Gemini 2.0 SDK documentation for assistance.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Submission Options:**

   - **Option 1**: Share the link to your Google Colab notebook. Ensure the permissions are set to "Anyone on the internet with the link can view."
   - **Option 2**: Upload your Google Colab notebook to a GitHub public repository and share the repository link.

2. **Submission Method:** Submit your completed work through the Google Classroom assignment submission portal.

**Important Note:**

- Any submission with restricted access (view-restricted Colab files or private GitHub repositories) will not be evaluated.
- Submitting blank or inaccessible documents will result in a zero score, and no re-submissions will be allowed under any circumstances.

**Deadline:**

- **Time:** 11:59 PM on **28/12/2024**.
- **Note:** The deadline will **not be extended** under any circumstances. Please plan accordingly.

**Tips:**

- Familiarize yourself with the Gemini 2.0 SDK by reviewing its official documentation. https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-v2
- Review the class code. https://github.com/JahanzaibTayyab/AI-201/blob/main/class04-20241222/4_02_Gemini_2_0_Flash.ipynb
