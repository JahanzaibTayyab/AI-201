# Assignment 06: Exploring LLM Models for Creative Video Generation and Script Analysis**

**Objective:**  
The goal of this assignment is to explore the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating creative content. Students will use an LLM to generate a video based on a creative prompt, save the generated video, and analyze it using Gemini LLM to produce a script with a detailed timeline.

**Instructions:**

1. **Step 1: Generate a Creative Video**

   - Select an LLM model capable of video generation (e.g., a multimodal LLM like OpenAI’s GPT-4 Vision or other suitable platforms).
   - Design a **creative and detailed prompt** for video generation. For example, “Create a short animated video showing the life of a tree through the seasons.”
   - Generate the video using the selected LLM.

2. **Step 2: Save the Generated Video**

   - Once the video is generated, save it to your local storage or a cloud platform (e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox).
   - Ensure the video is saved in a common format (e.g., MP4, MOV).

3. **Step 3: Pass the Video to Gemini LLM Using LangChain**

   - Utilize the LangChain framework to integrate Gemini LLM for video analysis.
   - Implement a LangChain pipeline that:
     - Takes the video as input.
     - Passes the video to Gemini LLM for analysis.
     - Outputs a detailed script and timeline of the video content.
   - Example LangChain workflow:
     - Define a file loader for video input.
     - Integrate Gemini LLM’s API to process video data.
     - Generate a structured script and timeline as output.

4. **Step 4: Generate a Script with Timeline**

   - Ensure the LangChain pipeline produces a **script** for the video, including:
     - Detailed descriptions of scenes.
     - Key events or transitions.
     - Timeline with timestamps for each major event or scene.
   - Example output:

     **Script Example:**

     - 00:00 - 00:05: Opening scene: A seed falls to the ground in a forest.
     - 00:06 - 00:15: The seed begins to sprout and grow into a sapling.
     - 00:16 - 00:30: The sapling grows into a mature tree, showcasing different seasons.

5. **Step 5: Implement and Submit in Google Colab**

   - Use Google Colab to implement all the steps of this assignment.
   - Document the process in a clear and organized manner, including the LangChain code, outputs, and explanations for each step.
   - Generate a shareable URL of your Colab notebook and ensure the permissions are set so that the instructor can view it.

6. **Step 6: Submit Your Work**
   - Upload the following to the submission portal:
     - The **original creative prompt** used for video generation.
     - The **shareable URL** of your Colab notebook.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Creativity and clarity of the initial prompt (1 point).
- Quality of the generated video (1 point).
- Accuracy and detail in the generated script and timeline (1 point).
- Implementation and documentation in Colab with LangChain (2 points).

**Bonus:**  
Earn 1 bonus point for including a reflection on the experience of using LangChain and LLMs for video generation and analysis. What were the challenges? What did you learn?

**Submission Deadline:** [05/01/2025]

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure originality in your work. Any form of plagiarism will result in disqualification.
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact

Good luck! Let your creativity shine!
