# Custom GPT Instructions Best Practices

### 1. **Instruction Optimization**

- **Be concise:** Optimize instructions syntactically, ensuring every word adds value.
- **Embrace telegraphic language:** Use concise, near-telegraphic phrasing for instructions to maximize token efficiency while maintaining clarity.
- **Use trigger words:** Select words that encapsulate significant meaning and are strongly tied to the desired task.

### 2. **Leveraging ChatGPT for Prompt Design**

- **Consult ChatGPT for ideas:** Ask how it would approach the task and analyze its phrasing for effective triggers.
- **Identify associated terms:** Use terms ChatGPT frequently associates with the task (e.g., “approachable” for simple language).

### 3. **Instruction Delivery**

- **Provide layered instructions:**
  - Use condensed instructions as system prompts for memory retention.
  - Provide detailed instructions in an uploaded document to cover nuance and examples.
- **Make instructions task-aware:** Ensure instructions direct GPT to read relevant uploaded documents based on the user’s current request.

### 4. **Document Optimization**

- **Streamline uploaded documents:**
  - Optimize for clarity and relevance, as GPT may only skim or read specific sections.
  - Use well-structured sections to aid GPT in finding pertinent information quickly.

### 5. **Specialized GPTs**

- **Create task-specific GPTs:** If a single GPT struggles to handle multiple tasks, develop dedicated GPTs for each specific function.
- **Use a “portal GPT” for navigation:**
  - A central GPT can identify user intent and link to the appropriate specialized GPT.
  - This approach simplifies user access and avoids the need for multiple bookmarks.

### 6. **Portal Website Option**

- Consider a portal website with links and explanations for specialized GPTs if feasible, but acknowledge some users may prefer simpler navigation solutions.
