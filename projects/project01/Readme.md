# Project 01: LangChain and Google Gemini Flash 2.0 Integration

**Objective:**

This assignment focuses on creating a LangChain-powered application using Google Gemini Flash 2.0. You will develop a Colab Notebook to demonstrate your understanding of integrating LangChain with Gemini Flash 2.0 and its capabilities for answering user questions.

**Task:**

- Create a Google Colab Notebook using LangChain and the Google Gemini Flash 2.0 API.
- Follow these steps:
  1. Set up your Colab environment by installing the required libraries and configuring the Gemini Flash model.
  2. Define a prompt template and create an LLM chain using LangChain.
  3. Run the chain with at least three user-defined questions and display the model's responses.
  4. Experiment with different prompt templates, parameters (e.g., temperature), and chain configurations to optimize responses.

**Guidelines:**

- Use the provided prerequisites and step-by-step instructions as a starting point. https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/tree/main/02_generative_ai_for_beginners/PROJECTS/01_hello_gemini
- Document your work clearly in the notebook with comments, explanations, and markdown cells.
- Extend the provided script by implementing at least one additional feature. For example Advanced Parameters: Experiment with Gemini Flash parameters such as max tokens or stop sequences.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Submission Requirements:**

   - Submit your completed project via this classroom assignment submission portal.
   - Additionally, fill out the https://forms.gle/b5Npy6eg4wKWro6m6. Both steps are mandatory.

2. **Important Note:**

   - Any submission with restricted access (view-restricted Colab files or private GitHub repositories) will not be evaluated.
   - Submitting blank or inaccessible documents will result in a zero score, and no re-submissions will be allowed under any circumstances.

**Deadline:**

- **Time:** 11:59 PM on **28/12/2024**.
- **Note:** The deadline will **not be extended** under any circumstances. Please plan accordingly.

**Learning Material:**

- https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-v2
- https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/
- https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/google/

**Output Expectations:**

Your Colab notebook should:

- Display the questions you provided to the LLM.
- Show the model's responses to each question.
- Include additional features or optimizations based on your experimentation.

We look forward to seeing your submissions. If you have any questions, feel free to ask before the deadline!
