   - **Front End (React)**
     - **File Upload**: Users can upload their resumes (PDF or DOCX).
     - **Job Description Input**: Users or recruiters enter job descriptions, which the system compares against the resume.
   - **Back End (FastAPI)**
     - **Text Extraction**: Process uploaded files, extracting text for NLP analysis.
     - **Feedback Generation**: Compare resume content to job descriptions, generate improvement suggestions, track user feedback history.
     - **Database Integration**: Store user data, resumes, and feedback in PostgreSQL.
   - **Database (PostgreSQL)**
     - **Tables**: Users, uploaded resumes, feedback history, job descriptions (optionally).

4. **Challenges**
   - **Resume Diversity**: Users have different resume formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.), often with complex layouts. Text extraction must be robust.
   - **Alignment to Multiple Roles**: A single user might apply to different roles, requiring distinct analyses and skill matches for each.
   - **Privacy & Security**: Resumes contain personal information. Ensuring secure data handling, storage, and compliance with privacy regulations is crucial.
   - **Model Accuracy**: GPT or other NLP models might generate generic or irrelevant advice without proper tuning, prompting, or domain-specific training.

## Realistic Completion Time

Below is a rough timeline for a team of 4–5 contributors working consistently. If there are limited resources or part-time commitments, timelines may need to be extended.

- **Short-Term (1–2 Months)**

  1. **Requirements & Architecture**
     - Finalize scope (key features, user flows, job role categories).
     - Choose libraries and services for file upload, text extraction (e.g., Python’s `pdfplumber`, `docx2python`), and GPT integration.
     - Set up the initial project structure (React front end, FastAPI back end, PostgreSQL).
  2. **Initial Prototype**
     - Build a minimal working product that lets users upload a resume and returns a basic text analysis (e.g., word count, basic skill extraction).
     - Outline a proof-of-concept GPT prompt to generate a short piece of feedback.

- **Mid-Term (3–5 Months)**

  1. **Core Functionality & Feedback Engine**
     - Integrate GPT or an alternative NLP pipeline to identify skills, compare them to job descriptions, and generate feedback.
     - Incorporate knowledge graph or skill taxonomy if needed (e.g., linking “JavaScript” to “React,” “Node.js,” etc.).
     - Implement a robust feedback mechanism (e.g., highlight missing skills, grammar suggestions, recommended certifications).
  2. **UI/UX Enhancements**
     - Expand the React front end to display feedback in a user-friendly manner (e.g., color-coded suggestions, skill gap charts).
     - Allow users to store multiple resumes, track revisions, and view feedback history.
  3. **Database & Security**
     - Set up PostgreSQL schemas to store user profiles, resumes, job descriptions, feedback logs.
     - Implement authentication and user access control.
     - Enhance resume data handling (e.g., encryption at rest or role-based data access if needed).

- **Long-Term (6–8+ Months)**
  1. **Advanced Features & Personalization**
     - Personalize feedback based on user career level or domain (e.g., entry-level, mid-level, senior).
     - Integrate sentiment analysis or advanced GPT fine-tuning to detect and guide tone and clarity in resumes.
     - Incorporate industry trends: real-time updates on emerging skills or keywords from job portals.
  2. **Testing & Refinement**
     - Conduct user tests with actual candidates or career services. Gather feedback on accuracy, clarity, and usability.
     - Fine-tune GPT prompts or model hyperparameters to reduce irrelevant or overly generic feedback.
  3. **Deployment & Maintenance**
     - Deploy the system to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) with CI/CD pipelines.
     - Plan for ongoing model updates, especially if job market changes rapidly (e.g., new tech roles).
     - Implement monitoring and analytics (e.g., track how often users incorporate feedback, overall satisfaction).
