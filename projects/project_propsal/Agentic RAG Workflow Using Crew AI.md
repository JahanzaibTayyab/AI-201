    - Establish connections with ChromaDB for local vector storage and test retrieval pipelines.
  - **Basic RAG Prototype**:
    - Implement a simple retrieval-augmented generation flow using local documents.
    - Test integration with a basic web-based data-fetching tool (e.g., Tavily AI).

- **Mid-Term (3–5 Months)**

  - **Advanced Agent Workflows**:
    - Develop specialized agents for routing, hallucination filtering, and response grading.
    - Fine-tune embedding models (Sentence Transformers, Hugging Face) for specific data domains.
    - Configure role-based delegation for improved scalability (e.g., add new agents for domain-specific queries).
  - **API & External Data Integration**:
    - Integrate Groq or other relevant cloud-based AI tools for more computationally heavy tasks.
    - Implement or refine keyword-based routing for efficiency.

- **Long-Term (6–8 Months)**

## Feedback and Suggestions

1. **Agent Coordination & Messaging**

   - Clearly define the protocol or mechanism by which agents exchange information. This ensures your hallucination filters or grading agents receive all necessary context.

2. **Hallucination Detection**

   - Consider a two-layer approach:
     - **Semantic Consistency Check**: Compare extracted facts from the original source with the generated answer.
     - **External Validation**: Use external knowledge checks (e.g., cross-referencing with an authoritative source) to flag discrepancies.

3. **Response Grading & Reporting**

   - Provide a confidence or reliability score for each final answer.
   - Maintain a log of how the system arrived at a given answer (agent trails), assisting in debugging and trust-building.

4. **Iterative Model Fine-Tuning**

   - Gather real-world user queries or logs to fine-tune Sentence Transformers or your chosen LLM for better domain accuracy over time.
   - Evaluate various open-source and commercial LLMs to see which best aligns with your project’s domain and cost constraints.

5. **Community Feedback Loop**

   - If you integrate with Discord or other platforms, implement a mechanism for end users to mark answers as helpful or incorrect.
   - Maintain a feedback repository to refine the system’s retrieval and generation logic.

6. **Scaling & Infrastructure**

   - If query volume becomes large, consider containerizing your solution (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for flexible scaling.
   - Optimize your vector database and embeddings for faster retrieval as data grows.

7. **Security Considerations**
   - Address data privacy and user authentication if handling private documents or sensitive web-based information.
   - Evaluate or implement role-based access control for collaborative environments.

   - Visualize how each agent interacts (routing agent, retrieval agent, hallucination filter, response grader, etc.).
   - Show data flow from ChromaDB and external web sources into the system.

2. **Project Plan / Gantt Chart**

   - Outline specific milestones (MVP creation, advanced agent build, user testing, final deployment).
   - Assign approximate dates or timeframes to each milestone to track progress.

3. **Risk Assessment**

   - Identify high-risk areas, such as unreliable external APIs or potential model drift.
   - Develop contingency plans (e.g., fallback to local documents if external data is unavailable).

4. **Documentation & DevOps Strategy**

   - Keep thorough documentation for agent roles, data pipelines, and usage instructions.
   - Implement CI/CD practices to ensure automated testing and deployment.

5. **Budget & Resource Allocation**

   - Consider the ongoing costs of API usage (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) and vector database hosting.
   - Plan for compute resources if advanced fine-tuning or real-time processing is expected to grow.

6. **Ethical & Legal Compliance**
   - If data is scraped from external sources, ensure proper licensing or compliance with those platforms’ usage policies.
   - Address potential bias in the LLM or embeddings by including diversity and fairness checks when training/fine-tuning models.
